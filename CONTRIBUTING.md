## Pull Requests
The preferred way to contribute is to fork the [main repository](https://github.com/hwakabh/webapp-101) on GitHub.
The brief procedures to fork this repo are described below, still we are also welcome if you would directly make PRs within this repository instead of forking.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/hwakabh/webapp-101).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_USERNAME}/webapp-101.git
$ cd webapp-101
```

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes.
```shell
$ git switch --create ${YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
```

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:
```shell
$ git add ${MODIFIED_FILENAME} [ ${MODIFIED_FILENAME} ... ]
$ git commit
```

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:
```shell
$ git push -u origin ${YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
```

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `webapp-101` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.
